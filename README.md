# fossrit-tahrir-theme

Custom FOSSRIT theme for Tahrir. To be used for the FOSSBox's Open Badges frontend.

## Usage

In your Tahrir virtualenv, install this theme from PyPI:

    pip install fossrit-tahrir-theme

In the config file you use to start your server, make sure the following
option is set:

    tahrir.theme_name = fossrit-tahrir-theme

So if you start your server with `pserve myconfig.ini --reload` or something
of that nature, you want to make the change in `myconfig.ini`. Tahrir by
default comes with a `production.ini` and a `development.ini`. You can make
use of one of these, or create your own based on one.

If those two things are all set, you should be good!
